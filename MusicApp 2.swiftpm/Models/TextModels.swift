    let lvlOneFirst = "You might have thought of this as a good representation of a meeting that happens in a moment of time and then ends, but this one aims to portrait an encounter where people leave the same way as they entered. Is it possible to not be affected in any way by someone? In fact, we are not really ever apart from each other. There is, and always will be, a kind of invisible thread that tangles all of the members in a community in a net of shared meanings and experiences."
    
    let lvlOneSecond = "This animation is meant to represent how unseparable we are from our collective. Is it possible to not be affected in any way by someone? In fact, we are never really apart from each other. There is, and always will be, a kind of invisible thread that tangles all of the members in a community in a net of shared meanings and experiences."
    
    let lvlOne = "We are all co-authors of the lives from people who surround us, as well as we are constantly rewriting it together - even in small interactions. The division between an audience, the \"amateurs\", and the musicians, the \"authors\", is ilusory. By observing and communicating signs to each other, be it synchronous or not, we are all creating the phenomenon of a song being perceived."
    
    
    let lvlTwoFirst = "Think about your relationship with... things. Do things exist prior to our experience of them? Chances are, if you chose this one, you might think so. Our perception of things at the time we interact with them is truly responsible for the creation of the phenomenon. And this perception is alive - continuously reflexive, always reformulating."
    
    let LvlTwoSecond = "Think about your relationship with... things. Do things exist prior to our experience of them? If you chose this one, you may be inclined to agree with the following statement. Our perception of things at the time we interact with them is truly responsible for the creation of the phenomenon. And this perception is alive - continuously reflexive, always reformulating."
    
    let lvlTwo = "Perception is also constantly updated by stimuli. While we might not realise it, our musical taste is incredibly flexible - if a song that we like gets related to a bad circumstance or context - such as being played on poor quality devices -, it rapidly becomes an unpleasant experience."
    
    let lvlThreeFirst = "Can you live the same experience two times? If you've chosen this animation, it's likely you'd say yes. What you might be missing is that you are the co-creator of every music you listen to. Because your subjectivity and the musicians' are a co-production, and because our perception of life is perpetuously actualizing, music does not exist."
    
    let lvlThreeSecond = "Can you live the same experience two times? If you've chosen this animation, you'd probably answer no. This one represents that you are the co-creator of every music you listen to. Hitting the play button is the first step to create a new experience. Because your subjectivity and the musicians' are a co-production, and because our perception of life is perpetuously actualizing, music does not exist."
    
    let lvlThree = "You can't access it outside of the present moment, outside of the very experience of it. Once it's gone, and you hear it again, you're already a different person in different circumstances - even if only slightly. Music can't be relievable - it is a beautiful, fleeting happening, and you are a unique point of view of it. The best part is: once you get the hang of it, you feel absolutely free to reinvent it. And nearly everything else... including yourself."
